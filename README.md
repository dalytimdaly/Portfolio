# README

This is the README for Timothy Daly's Portfolio project. This aims to be an easy to use gallery of projects built by Timothy Daly. The collection begins in August 2022 and extends to the current day. The website itself will also demonstrate the best of my full stack engineering capabilities by integrating complex features, such as Authentication and Authorization of user accounts, Active Storage Image Attachements, an Action Cable messaging system, and independently built CSS and HTML elements. I will refrain from using packages and libraries as much as possible in order to independently figure out the more difficult logical and syntactical problems presented in modern day website design and functionality. Thank you for your patience while it is being built.

As of 01/09/23, basic functionality and image attachments are working. One can create projects, edit them and attach or remove images as desired. User profiles, CSS elements and more are being actively built.

Project goals are being tracked via Trello, but will soon be switched to JIRA. Project conceptual designs are currently being made using Figma.

This README will normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
